#Assignment Title: Introduction to DevOps and Version Control
Level: Internship
Course: DevOps
Duration: 1 week

#Assignment Objective
This assignment is designed to introduce you to the essential tools and practices used in DevOps, including setting up a development environment, using Git for version control, and understanding real-world applications through case studies.


#Task 1: Setting Up Your Development Environment
Instructions:
##Step 1: Install Linux or WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
Install a Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu) using either a virtual machine or WSL2 on your local machine.
Provide screenshots showing the installation process and confirmation of your Linux environment running.

##Step 2: Set up essential tools:
Install Git and other required tools (e.g., curl, wget, etc.).
Run basic Linux and Git commands to verify the setup:
git --version
ls
pwd
Deliverables:
Screenshots of your installed environment.
Output of the terminal commands mentioned above.

#Task 2: Case Studies on DevOps Practices
Instructions:
##Step 1: Research case studies from leading tech companies that utilize DevOps practices:
Netflix: Focus on how they leverage DevOps for rapid deployment and service reliability.
Google: Explore their use of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) as part of DevOps.
Amazon: Discuss how Amazon Web Services (AWS) applies DevOps principles for scalability and flexibility.

##Step 2: Write a report comparing the DevOps practices of these companies.
Highlight the tools, processes, and strategies each company uses.
Discuss how these practices contribute to faster deployment, better collaboration, and improved system reliability.
Reflect on how these practices might be relevant for smaller organizations.

Deliverables:
A well-researched and referenced report in PDF format.
Minimum of 3 references per company.


#Task 3: GitHub Repository Setup and Version Control
Instructions:.
##Step 1: Create a GitHub repository
Initialize a new GitHub repository for this assignment.
Provide a README.md file with details about the repository.

##Step 2: Basic Git Workflow
Clone the repository to your local environment.
Create a .gitignore file and add relevant entries (e.g., logs, OS-specific files).
Add, commit, and push changes to the repository.


##Step 3: Branching Strategy:
Create two new branches: feature-xy and bugfix-xy.
Make changes to files in each branch and push them separately to GitHub.

Deliverables:
GitHub repository link.
List of branches created with a brief explanation of changes in each branch.
Screenshot showing commits pushed to different branches.


#Task 4: Merge Conflicts and Resolution
Instructions:.
##Step 1: Simulate and Resolve Merge Conflicts:
Make conflicting changes in the feature-xy and bugfix-xy branches.
Push the resolved conflict and final merged changes to GitHub.

Step 2: Document the Process
Explain the cause of the merge conflict.
Describe the steps taken to resolve the conflict.
Provide screenshots of the conflict and resolution.

Deliverables:
A document detailing the merge conflict and resolution steps..
Final GitHub repository link with all branches merged.
Screenshots showing the conflict and resolution.
